    <h2>Rock, paper, or scissors game â€“ open the console to play!</h2>
    <p>This project was created for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>. It is intentionally built to run entirely in the console, as the goal of the exercise is to practice JavaScript fundamentals without focusing on the user interface</p>
